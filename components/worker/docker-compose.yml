    # NOTE: depends_on with health conditions cannot reference services from
    # components/infra/docker-compose.yml because they run as separate Compose
    # projects. The root-level `make up` handles cross-compose health ordering
    # by running `wait-for-infra` between starting infra and backend services.
    # For manual startup, ensure infra is healthy first:
    #   cd components/infra && make up
    # then start this service.
